# webAutomation
This Python script automates the process of downloading and consolidating electricity market data from the SMARD (Strommarktdaten) website. It uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate the SMARD download center, select various data categories, and download CSV files. The script then processes these files and combines them into a consolidated report.
